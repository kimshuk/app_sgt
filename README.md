# Student Grade Table

### Overview

This is an application that performs CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations which essentially takes input values and applies them to objects and updates the DOM with a visual of those objects stored. Said objects in this case are names and grades of students that are added to the DOM. The data is prepopulated from my personal database via MySQL query. This application was styled solely with Boostrap.

### Features I Want to Implement in Future Iterations
- [ ] **Duplicate Check** - Checks student name and class with database for duplicated info and rejects it.
- [ ] **Object Oriented** - Apply object oriented programming to students and application.
- [ ] **Local Storage** - Local state storage between page loads.
- [ ] **Sorting** - Sort students by name / grade / course
- [ ] **Auto-Complete** - Course entry auto complete
