# Student Grade Table

### Overview

This is an application that performs CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations which essentially takes input values and applies them to objects and updates the DOM with a visual of those objects stored. The data is prepopulated from my personal database via MySQL query. This application was styled solely with Boostrap.

### Upcoming projected improvements
- [ ] **Duplicate Check** - Checks student name and class with database for duplicated info and rejects it.
- [ ] **Object Oriented** - Apply object oriented programming to students and application.
- [ ] **Local Storage** - Local state storage between page loads.
- [ ] **Sorting** - Sort students by name / grade / course
- [ ] **Auto-Complete** - Course entry auto complete
